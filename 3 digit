#Write a Python module that reads a 3-digit number from a file (e.g. user_pick.txt)
#and compares that number to a 3-digit computer-generated number (HINT:  each digit needs to be generated separately).
#The result of this comparison will be as follows:

#If the user's number (pick) contains 1 number from the computer generated pick, then print a statement of a $1 award
#If the user's number (pick) contains 2 numbers from the computer generated pick, then print a statement of a $100 award
#If the user's number (pick) contains 3 numbers from the computer generated pick, then print a statement of a $1000 award
#If the user's number (pick) is an EXACT MATCH (same 3 numbers in the same order), then print a statement of a $10000 award


import random
from random import randint
# generate 3 random numbers for lottery 
computer_generate1 = random.randint(1,9)
computer_generate2 = random.randint(1,9)
computer_generate3 = random.randint(1,9)
#create a variable 
realNumber = str(computer_generate1) + str(computer_generate2) + str(computer_generate3)
# open numbers in read mode using with/as
with open("numbers.txt") as f:
    number = f.readline()
print(number)
print(realNumber)
   

#If the user's number (pick) is an EXACT MATCH (same 3 numbers in the same order), then print a statement of a $10000 award   
if number == realNumber:
    print("You won $10,000")
#create an if elif statement for printing the differnt  computer generate options     
count = 0
for i in number:
  if i == str(computer_generate1):
      count += 1
  elif i == str(computer_generate2):
      count += 1
  elif i == str(computer_generate3):
      count += 1
